The following resources are extracted from game executables:

File                   Origin        Offset   Size
early/cursors.bin      xanth.exe     29b20h   68
	Currently the default cursor I'm using for the early games
	is one of the cursors from Companions of Xanth. To create
	cursors.bin, put 4 00 bytes in a new file for the hotspot,
	followed by the 68 bytes listed above for the cursor image
early/help.txt         gatemain.exe  1f5a7h
gateway/commands.bin   gatemain.exe  1064eh   824
